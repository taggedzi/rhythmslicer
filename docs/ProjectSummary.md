**Project Summary: RhythmSlicer Pro**

**Concept:** RhythmSlicer Pro is a cross-platform (Windows, Linux, macOS) TUI music player launched from the CLI, inspired by the classic WinAmp experience and reimagined through a cyberpunk aesthetic. It’s designed for users who appreciate functional, technically-minded applications and a nostalgic, “secret” feel.

**Core Functionality:** The application provides a Textual TUI for MP3 playback and playlist management, plus CLI helpers for playlist utilities.

**Technical Details:**

*   **CLI Command:** The primary command is `r-slicer`.
*   **Visual Style:** The TUI utilizes ASCII art and a dark color palette (primarily black and gray) with neon accent colors (pink, cyan, green) to evoke a cyberpunk atmosphere. It aims for a visual style reminiscent of WinAmp’s iconic waveform display.
*   **Underlying Technology:** RhythmSlicer Pro leverages the robust backend system of VLC media player for all audio playback. This enables advanced features like:
    *   High-quality MP3 decoding and playback.
    *   Support for various audio codecs.
    *   Volume control and playback speed adjustments.
*   **Key Features:**
    *   MP3 playback
    *   Playlist management (creation, editing, loading)
    *   Basic playback controls (play, pause, stop, volume adjustment – represented via ASCII characters)
    *   Dynamic waveform visualization (rendered in ASCII characters)
    *   Potential for future features (depending on development direction – this is a “Pro” version with a focus on core functionality).
*   **Target Audience:** Programmers, sysadmins, developers, and technically-minded users who appreciate a functional, nostalgic, and somewhat “secret” application.

**Overall Tone:** The project aims for a blend of retro functionality and a subtly dark, cyberpunk aesthetic – creating a unique and compelling user experience.
